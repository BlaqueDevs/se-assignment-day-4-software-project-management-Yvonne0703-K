## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall:

* Imagine a traditional construction project:  You carefully plan every step in advance, from laying the foundation to painting the walls.  You complete each stage one by one, moving sequentially down the "waterfall" of steps.
* Advantages:  Structured, predictable, and easy to manage. Great for projects with clear requirements and minimal risk.
* Disadvantages:  Less flexible, difficult to adapt to changes, and can lead to delays if issues arise late in the process.

Agile:

Imagine a more iterative approach:  You build the house in smaller chunks, starting with the foundation and then adding rooms as you go. You get feedback from the homeowner after each stage and adjust the plans accordingly.
 Advantages:  Flexible, adaptable to changes, and promotes collaboration. Ideal for projects with uncertain requirements or evolving needs.* Disadvantages:  Can be less structured, may require more communication and coordination, and might not be suitable for projects with strict deadlines.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature | Waterfall | Agile |

| Approach | Sequential, plan-driven | Iterative, incremental |
| Flexibility | Less flexible | Highly flexible |
| Requirements | Defined upfront | Evolve over time |
| Communication | Formal, documented | Frequent, collaborative |
| Testing | Performed at the end | Continuous throughout |
| Suitable for | Projects with clear requirements, low risk | Projects with uncertain requirements, high risk |

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is better suited for:

Projects with evolving requirements:  Think of developing a new mobile app. User feedback and market trends might change throughout the development process. Agile allows for adjustments along the way.
